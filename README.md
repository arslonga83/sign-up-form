# sign-up-form

Odin Project simple sign up form. There was a lot to take in reading this section and this project helped everything make sense. I included more outside assets - namely the image, icon, and font. Took awhile to figure out the Javascript to check password match, but google helped point out that you need to check the "value", not the object itself. Styling still feels like the hardest part, but I did my best to match color tones from the image....I specifically chose to do my own design rather than copy the Odin version, so that I would have to flex those muscles.
